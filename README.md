A library to help build secure Google Cloud services using Dart Frog.

## Features

The main feature provided by Cloud Frog is a Dart Frog middleware that can be used to authenticate incoming requests when the service is deployed to Google Cloud Run.

## Getting started

When deploying a Dart Frog service to Google Cloud Run, there is generally a need to authenticate incoming requests.
Cloud Frog addresses a subset of this requirement by allowing to validate requests that are authenticated using an OIDC token with a service account's credentials.
